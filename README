This is the game prototype ive been working on.

I used flash develop and flixel.

You'll need to add the classpath to the flixel lib on your machine in flashdevelop to run it.

Things i'm planning on doing at some point:

1- instead of rects for the buildings a random assortment of animated sprites
2- hitboxes for weapons / smaller hitbox for sliding sprite
3- template baddie class that can be extended.
4- template powerup class
