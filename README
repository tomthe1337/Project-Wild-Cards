PROTOTYPE - jump the gap

I used flash develop and flixel.

You'll need to add the classpath to the flixel in flashdevelop.

Things i'm planning on doing at some point:

1- instead of rects for the buildings a random assortment of animated sprites
2- hitboxes for different weapons
3- different baddies / animated sprites		SORT OF DONE
4- powerups?
5- weather foreground effect - other sprites change
6- day/night - silhouette foreground / player / buildings
7- balancing - testing

GRAPHICS to do

'buildings' - dont have to be buildings, could be anything
background - animated
foreground - animated
player - run, jump, fall, slide/roll attack
obstacles - could be anything.
